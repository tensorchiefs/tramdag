"""PreToolUse guard for the autoresearch run — protect the measurement.

Reads the tool-call JSON on stdin and exits 2 (block) when the call would:
  * EDIT the measurement — anything under tests/ or data/, or the benchmark
    harness experiments/bench_training.py; or
  * READ the *target values* — test assertions (tests/test_*.py),
    reference numbers (data/**/truth.json, data/**/ref_ls/**), incl. obvious
    shell reads of them.

It deliberately ALLOWS reading the input data (data/**/obs.csv, rct.csv — the
agent must fit these) and the harness source (it must run it). Read-blocking is
a deterrent, not airtight: pytest and any Python the agent runs read files at the
OS level, which a tool-hook can't intercept. The load-bearing anti-overfitting
guard remains the mission's rule that a win must generalize off the harness.

Activate on the research machine only by copying
.claude/settings.local.example.json -> .claude/settings.local.json (git-ignored),
so it never affects other checkouts. Exit 0 = allow; fails open on any error so a
malformed event can't wedge the agent.
