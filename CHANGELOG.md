# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **`fit(marginal_init=True)`** — opt-in calibrated initialization for *unconditional*
  (`SimpleIntercept`) nodes, replacing zuko's default zero init. Bernstein roots
  start at the linear map of the pre-scaled domain onto the standard-logistic
  5/95 quantiles (the default is ~2.5× too steep); ordinal roots start at the
  empirical class log-odds (default zeros ≈ uniform). A **pure init** — the
  converged MLE is unchanged (the exact-`ls` MLE / R-`polr` equivalence is
  preserved), applied once on the first fit, conditional `ci` intercepts untouched.
  Large time-to-target win where a root's marginal shape dominates the NLL gap
  (vaca-ci ~2.5× faster to target over 6 seeds); small where convergence is
  coefficient-bound. Defaults unchanged (off). See `docs/research/REPORT.md`.

- **`CausalFlowDAG.fit_classical()`** — deterministic, full-batch, **float64**
  L-BFGS for all-`ls` models (each node-conditional is then a classical
  transformation model). Bit-reproducible, reaches the exact MLE, matches
  `statsmodels` ordered-logit / R `polr`/`Colr` to ~1e-3 on well-identified
  coefficients; raises on `cs`/`ci` specs (use `fit()`). Plus `ls_coefficients()`
  to read the per-node shift weights. float64 is a transient compute mode
  (`self.double()/.float()`), so the stored model stays float32; as a side effect
  the data path (`_tensorize`/`sample`/`pmf`) is now dtype-agnostic.
- `notebooks/classical_fit_tram_dag.py` (didactic) and a `--classical` flag for
  `experiments/validate_ls.py`.
- **Next:** standard-error table from the float64 Hessian at the MLE (the float64
  bracket here is the groundwork); needs a reference-level constraint for the
  one-hot ordinal-parent flat directions.

## 0.2.0 (2026-06-12)

First PyPI release: `pip install tramdag`.

### Changed (naming & packaging)

- **Renamed**: Python package `zuko_dag` → **`tramdag`** (conventional alias
  `import tramdag as td`); GitHub repo `tram-dag-zuko` → `tensorchiefs/tramdag`
  (old URLs redirect). The package implements TRAM-DAGs; zuko names the backend.
  No API changes; old checkpoints still load. References to the original
  Keras/TF implementation (tensorchiefs/tram-dag) reworded to avoid
  self-reference.
- **MIT license** added; PyPI metadata (authors, urls, classifiers); runtime
  dependencies trimmed to `torch`, `zuko`, `numpy`, `pandas` (pytest/scipy/
  statsmodels/scikit-learn/matplotlib moved to the `dev` dependency group).
- **README rewritten method-first**: the repo is the reference implementation of
  the CLeaR 2025 paper (arXiv:2503.16206); the stroke analysis is the case study
  (arXiv:2606.12623) with its detail moved to `docs/stroke-case-study.md`.
  Citation BibTeX added for both papers.

### Added

- **`fit(schedule=..., freeze_patience=...)`** — learning-rate schedules and
  per-node early stopping (defaults unchanged). The optimizer now holds one
  param group per node; `schedule="plateau"` decays each node's lr off its own
  validation NLL, and `freeze_patience` drops converged nodes from the loss
  (real FLOP savings — per-node gradients are independent) with early exit when
  all nodes froze. Also `"onecycle"`/`"cosine"`. Benchmarks + recommendation in
  `docs/training-speed.md` (`experiments/bench_training.py`): plateau+freeze
  matches the hand-tuned two-phase recipe's time-to-accuracy with **no budget
  tuning and ~3× less total compute**; full-batch LBFGS solves the classical
  all-`ls` MLE in <2 s (2/3 seeds). Existing defaults intentionally untouched.
- **Colab demo** `notebooks/demo_tram_dag_colab.py` (+ tracked output-stripped
  `.ipynb` for the badge): the paper's bimodal VACA benchmark fitted live
  (cuda/cpu auto-detect), L1 pairs plot, analytic do-checks, per-individual
  counterfactuals vs DGP truth, GPU-vs-CPU race.

- **The TRAM-DAG paper's DGPs** (Sick & Dürr, CLeaR 2025, arXiv:2503.16206) as
  simulation registry families, each a numpy-only SCM with known/analytic ground
  truth + frozen n=5000 CSVs (`data/<name>/`, the test contract) and CLIs:
  - `simulations/triangle.py` — `TriangleContinuous` (§6.1: logistic-latent TRAM
    DGP, h₂=5x₂+2x₁, h₃=0.63x₃−0.2x₁−f(x₂)) and `TriangleMixed` (§6.2: ordinal x₃,
    θ=(−2, 0.42, 1.02)); f variants `linear`/`cubic`/`exp`/`atan`/`sin`; supports
    array-valued `do` (C.4 soft interventions).
  - `simulations/vaca.py` — `VacaTriangle` (App. C.1 bimodal Gaussian L1/L2
    benchmark vs CNF).
  - `simulations/carefl.py` — `Carefl4` (App. C.2 Laplace SCM; **analytic**
    counterfactuals via `abduct_noise`/`true_counterfactual`).
- `experiments/paper_{triangle,triangle_mixed,vaca,carefl}.py` (+ `paper_common.py`)
  — replicate the paper's figures: coefficient trajectories (Fig. 14/15/19), CS-curve
  recovery (Fig. 7), L1/L2 distribution overlays (Fig. 4/5/9/16/20), counterfactual
  curves at the paper's x_obs (Fig. 6), and the C.4 odds-ratio check (OR ≈ 7.4).
- `tests/test_paper_dgps.py` — generator pinning (KS TRAM-identities, frozen-CSV
  contract, analytic ground truth) + flow recovery (coefficients with the ordinal
  sign-flip, CS curve, VACA do-moments, CAREFL counterfactual MAE).

### Changed (behavior)

- **`CausalFlowDAG.fit(..., restore_best=False)` is now the default.** Training keeps
  the **final converged weights** instead of restoring per-node best-validation
  weights. Rationale:
  - *Least surprise* — `fit()` returns the model you trained, not a silently
    swapped earlier epoch.
  - *Exact classical comparison* — an all-`ls` model trained to convergence is now
    exactly the maximum-likelihood (proportional-odds) estimate, matching
    `statsmodels` `OrderedModel` and R `MASS::polr` to ~1e-3 (see
    `experiments/validate_ls.py`, `tests/test_simulations.py::test_all_ls_flow_is_exact_mle`).
    This was **not achievable before**: best-validation restoration pinned the fit
    off the training optimum.
  - Early stopping is now an explicit, opt-in regularization choice.

  To restore the previous behavior, pass `restore_best=True`.

  **Note for flexible (`ci`/`cs`) models:** their MLE *overfits the observational
  confounding*, so they need `restore_best=True` to recover the causal effect (lower
  validation NLL confirms it generalizes better). `experiments/run_experiment`
  therefore defaults `restore_best` per style — off for all-`ls`, on for flexible.

### Added

- `src/tramdag/simulations/magic_mrclean.py` — synthetic stroke cohort (SCM with
  known ground truth); `ls`/`nl` variants; CLI to (re)generate frozen CSVs.
- `data/magic-mrclean/` — frozen public CSVs + `fit_ls.R` classical R reference and
  committed `ref_ls/` outputs. The public, reproducible substitute for the private
  clinical data.
- `experiments/common.py::load_data(source)` — switch between `"magic"` (private) and
  `"magic-mrclean/{ls,nl}"` (synthetic, default).
- `experiments/sim_flow.py` — known-truth recovery storyline; `validate_ls.py`
  rewritten as a spot-on flow-vs-MLE-vs-R comparison.
- `tests/test_simulations.py` — generator, known-truth recovery, the all-`ls`
  spot-on MLE check, and the Python-vs-R regression.
