**TRAM-DAGs** model each variable of a structural causal model with a
(transformation-model) flow: one triangular normalizing flow from iid
standard-logistic latents to the observed variables. The triangular adjacency
structure is exactly your causal DAG. Fit it **once** on observational data and answer all
three rungs of Pearl's causal hierarchy — observational (L1), interventional
(L2, the do-operator), and counterfactual (L3, Pearl abduction) — while keeping
**interpretable effects**: every linear-shift coefficient is a log-odds ratio,
exactly as in classical proportional-odds models.

**5-minute showcase**: the [Colab badge above](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorchiefs/tramdag/blob/main/notebooks/demo_tram_dag_colab.ipynb) fits the paper's bimodal benchmark
live and walks L1 → L2 → L3, every answer checked against analytic
ground truth. Further notebooks are available at [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) like the didactic walkthrough of the model:
[`notebooks/intro_tram_dag.py`](notebooks/intro_tram_dag.py).

## 30 seconds of API

```python
from tramdag import CausalFlowDAG, ContinuousNode, OrdinalNode, I, LS, CS

spec = {  # the spec IS the labelled DAG
    "X1": ContinuousNode(),
    "X2": ContinuousNode(I("X1")),
    "T": OrdinalNode(2, LS("X1") + CS("X2")),  # 2 levels, column coded 0..1
    "Y": OrdinalNode(4, I("X1") + CS("X2") + LS("T")),
}
# train_df / val_df: DataFrames with one column per node
flow = CausalFlowDAG(spec)  # validates acyclicity, builds the flow

# fit() is one minibatch Adam loop with Keras-shaped extras: validation_data=
# (or validation_split=0.1) records the per-epoch validation NLL in
# flow.history["val"], verbose= prints progress; schedules and early stopping
# attach through optimizer= and callbacks= (docs/fitting.md)
from tramdag.callbacks import EarlyStopping

flow.fit(
    train_df,
    epochs=4000,
    batch_size=512,
    validation_data=val_df,
    verbose=100,
    # keep the best-validation weights; stop once the best is 200 epochs old
    callbacks=[EarlyStopping(patience=200)],
)

# all-`ls` model? fit it classically instead: deterministic float64 L-BFGS,
# exact MLE matching statsmodels/R (see docs/fitting.md)
flow.fit_classical(train_df)  # raises on cs/ci/vc specs

flow.log_prob(df)  # L1: joint log-likelihood per row
flow.sample(1000)  # L1: observational sampling
flow.sample(1000, do={"T": 1})  # L2: interventional (graph mutilation)
flow.pmf(df, node="Y", do={"T": 1})  # L2: analytic interventional PMF
flow.density(df, node="X2", grid=grid, do={"X1": 0.5})  # ... and density, continuous nodes

u = flow.abduct(df)  # L3 step 1: latents from observations
cf = flow.sample(do={"T": 1}, u=u)  # L3 steps 2+3: counterfactuals

flow.ls_coefficients()  # interpret: per-edge log-odds-ratios (LS terms)
# per-parent partial effects of an additive complex intercept (centered):
# flow.intercept_contributions(df, "Y") on a CI("A", "B", allow_interaction=False)

# heterogeneous treatment effects: a small, penalized effect head beta(x)*T
# (VC term) with a first-class read-out — see docs/varying-coefficients.md
# e.g. CS("X1", "X2") + VC("X1", t="T") ->
# flow.varying_coef(df, "Y")               # beta(x): deterministic, y-free

flow.scores(df, node="Y")  # per-observation scores dl_i/dtheta
flow.effect_modifier_scan(df, "Y", t="T")  # which VC modifiers? (CUSUM
# scan from a cheap all-ls fit) — docs/scores.md

flow.save("flow.pt")
flow = CausalFlowDAG.load("flow.pt")
```

## The model in detail: spec → math → networks

Per node, the transformation is additive on the latent (log-odds) scale — one
intercept term `I` plus any number of shifts (notation:
[`docs/notation.md`](docs/notation.md)):

`u = h_ϑ(x) + Σ β·x_pa + Σ g(x_pa) + (β₀ + b_Θ(x_mod))·x_t`

| term | math | what gets built | interpretability |
|---|---|---|---|
| `I()` / bare `I` / omitted | `h_ϑ(x)` — constant ϑ | `SimpleIntercept`: one free parameter vector, no network | the baseline transform |
| `I("A")` | `h_ϑ(a)(x)` — ϑ bends with the parent | `ComplexIntercept`: NN `[8, 8] → n_params` | the parent reshapes the whole distribution; no single coefficient |
| `I("A","B")` (default `allow_interaction=True`) | `h_ϑ(a,b)(x)` | **one joint** NN over both parents — they interact in ϑ | maximal flexibility |
| `I("A","B", allow_interaction=False)` | `h_ϑ(a)+ϑ(b)(x)` | one NN **per parent**, parameter vectors summed in coefficient space | per-parent partial effects via `flow.intercept_contributions` |
| `LS("A")` | `β·a` | `Linear(width, 1)`, no bias — **one parameter per feature column** (one for a continuous parent, `levels` for a one-hot ordinal) | `exp(β)` is an odds ratio |
| `CS("A")` | `g(a)`, additive | `ComplexShift`: NN `[64, 128, 64] → 1` | plot `g` |
| `CS("A","B")` | `g(a,b)` — joint | one NN over the concatenated features | interaction *in the shift* |
| `CS("A") + CS("B")` | `g₁(a) + g₂(b)` | two NNs, scalars added | GAM-style, each effect plottable |
| `VC("A","B", t="T")` | `(β₀ + b_Θ(a,b))·x_t` | scalar `β₀` + zero-initialised penalized NN `[16] → 1`; the treatment value multiplies, it never enters the net | `β₀` ≈ constant effect, `flow.varying_coef` reads `β(x)` |

A node takes **at most one `I` term with parents** — a term list is therefore
always purely additive on the latent scale, and interactions exist only
*inside* a term. Lists and `+` sums are interchangeable:
`[LS("A"), CS("B")]` ≡ `LS("A") + CS("B")`.

Three knobs on the terms:

- **`transform=` on `I`** picks the basis of `h_ϑ` for a continuous node —
  `"bernstein"` (default, 20 coefficients, tails extrapolate with the boundary
  slope), `"spline"` (monotone RQ spline, 23 params at `bins=8`, fixed tail
  slope) or `"affine"` (2 params: the latent is exactly logistic). Ordinal
  nodes have no basis: their intercept is the cutpoint vector,
  `P(x ≤ k) = σ(ϑ_k − shift)`.
- **`input_transform=` on `CI`/`CS`/`VC`** — `"minmax"`, `"standardize"`, or
  a callable `fn(x, train)` — transforms that term's continuous network
  inputs with statistics frozen at the first fit; `LS` and the `VC`
  treatment stay raw, so their coefficients keep their units.
- **`units=` on `I`/`CS`/`VC`** sizes the term's network, e.g. `units=[16]`
  for one hidden layer of 16 neurons. The defaults match the PyTorch
  reference this package grew out of ([buehlpa/TramDag](https://github.com/buehlpa/TramDag),
  `tram_models.py`), **not** the TRAM-DAG paper's own R nets — so a
  replication sets `units=` and `activation=` explicitly, as the configs in
  `experiments/paper/` do.

Feature widths: a continuous parent enters raw (1 column), an ordinal parent
one-hot (`levels` columns). Abduction is exact for continuous nodes and
truncated-logistic for ordinal ones, so `flow.sample(u=flow.abduct(df))`
reproduces `df` exactly / level-exactly.

There are two ways to fit the model: a stochastic optimizer (`fit`) and the classical route (`fit_classical`). For all-`ls` models — where each node-conditional is a classical transformation model — the classical fit is deterministic and takes seconds (measured ~10 s vs ~200 s for Adam on the CI runner — before the 2026-09 epoch cut made the Adam route ~3.5x faster; CI re-measures on the next push); see [`docs/fitting.md`](docs/fitting.md).

## Validation

Two layers, deliberately separate.

**The framework's own test suite** ([`tests/`](tests/)) measures the library
against three inline data-generating processes it carries itself, so it needs no
research code to run. Its strongest claim is an equality, not a similarity: an
all-`ls` outcome node *is* an ordered-logit model, so the flow's MLE must match
`statsmodels` `OrderedModel` on the same design matrix — it does, and the
varying-coefficient acceptance bars (effect recovery, propensity centering) are
pinned the same way. What the tests guarantee, and how each ground truth is
obtained, is documented in [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md).

**The paper replications** ([`experiments/`](experiments/)) are separate: one
self-contained script per dataset, with its hyperparameters in a sibling YAML
file and its expected results committed under each area's `ground_truth/`. A
dedicated workflow runs them and compares.

| experiment | paper | demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| `triangle.py` (`linear-ls`, `linear-cs`, `atan-cs`, `sin-cs`) | §6.1, C.3 | LS coefficient recovery (β = 2, −0.2, +0.3), CS curve ≡ −f(x₂) for non-monotone f |
| `triangle_mixed.py` (`linear-ls`, `exp-cs`) | §6.2 | mixed data L1/L2 + the C.4 odds-ratio check (OR ≈ 7.4) |
| `vaca.py` | §5.1–5.2 | the bimodal L1 case a default CNF misses; L2 `p(x₃ \| do(x₂))` against analytic means |
| `carefl.py` | §5.3 | L3 counterfactual curves vs **analytic** truth |
| `validate_ls.py` | — | flow ≡ `statsmodels` ≡ R `MASS::polr` to ~4 decimals with `fit_classical` (a converged Adam `fit` gets ~1e-3), on a frozen synthetic cohort with a known true effect |

Sign note: ordinal shifts are *subtracted* here but *added* in the paper, so
fitted ordinal weights are the paper's with flipped sign (each `truth.json`
records both conventions). A figure-by-figure account of what is reproduced,
and what is not (the competing CNF/NSF baselines), is in
[`experiments/paper/PAPER_COVERAGE.md`](experiments/paper/PAPER_COVERAGE.md).

**Training speed** — schedules, per-node freezing, L-BFGS and device benchmarks:
[`docs/training-speed.md`](docs/training-speed.md).

**Paper replication** — every hyperparameter of the eight `experiments/paper`
variants with its source in the paper's R code, the deviations, and the
numbers (paper / previous protocol / now):
[`docs/paper-replication.md`](docs/paper-replication.md).
