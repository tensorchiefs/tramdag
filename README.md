**TRAM-DAGs** model each variable of a structural causal model with a
(transformation-model) flow: one triangular normalizing flow from iid
standard-logistic latents to the observed variables. The structure is of the triangular 
Adjacency Matrix is exactly your causal DAG. Fit it **once** on observational data and answer all
three rungs of Pearl's causal hierarchy — observational (L1), interventional
(L2, the do-operator), and counterfactual (L3, Pearl abduction) — while keeping
**interpretable effects**: every linear-shift coefficient is a log-odds ratio,
exactly as in classical proportional-odds models.

**5-minute showcase**: the [Colab badge above](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorchiefs/tramdag/blob/main/notebooks/demo_tram_dag_colab.ipynb) fits the paper's bimodal benchmark
live (GPU-ready) and walks L1 → L2 → L3, every answer checked against analytic
ground truth. Further notebooks are available at [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) like the didactic walkthrough of the model:
[`notebooks/intro_tram_dag.py`](notebooks/intro_tram_dag.py).

## 30 seconds of API

```python
import tramdag as td
from tramdag import CausalFlowDAG, ContinuousNode, OrdinalNode, I, LS, CS

spec = {                                  # the spec IS the labelled DAG
    "Age":     ContinuousNode(),
    "mRS_pre": OrdinalNode(levels=6, terms=[I("Age")]),
    "NIHSSa":  ContinuousNode(terms=[I("Age"), LS("mRS_pre")]),
    "T":       OrdinalNode(levels=2,
                           terms=[I("Age"), LS("mRS_pre"), CS("NIHSSa")]),
    "mRS_3m":  OrdinalNode(levels=7,
                           terms=[I("Age"), LS("mRS_pre"),
                                  CS("NIHSSa"), LS("T")]),
}
flow = CausalFlowDAG(spec)                # validates acyclicity, builds the flow

# self-stopping training: per-node plateau lr decay + freezing of converged
# nodes (exact, since the per-node NLLs have independent gradients);
# see docs/training-speed.md for benchmarks and the classic two-phase recipe
flow.fit(train_df, val_df, epochs=4000, learning_rate=1e-2,
         schedule="plateau", plateau_patience=30, freeze_patience=120)

# all-`ls` model? fit it classically instead: deterministic float64 L-BFGS,
# exact MLE matching statsmodels/R (see notebooks/classical_fit_tram_dag.py)
flow.fit_classical(train_df)               # raises on cs/ci specs

flow.log_prob(df)                          # L1: joint log-likelihood per row
flow.sample(1000)                          # L1: observational sampling
flow.sample(1000, do={"T": 1})             # L2: interventional (graph mutilation)
flow.pmf(df, node="mRS_3m", do={"T": 1})   # L2: analytic interventional PMF

u  = flow.abduct(df)                       # L3 step 1: latents from observations
cf = flow.sample(do={"T": 1}, u=u)         # L3 steps 2+3: counterfactuals

flow.ls_coefficients()                     # interpret: per-edge log-odds-ratios
flow.intercept_contributions("NIHSSa", df) # interpret: per-parent partial effects
                                           # of an additive complex intercept (centered)

flow.save("flow.pt"); flow = CausalFlowDAG.load("flow.pt")

## The model in one table

Per node, the transformation is additive on the latent (log-odds) scale —
`u = h(x; θ) + Σ β·x_pa + Σ g(x_pa)` — and each parent edge declares how it enters:

| edge term | meaning | interpretability |
|---|---|---|
| `ls` | linear shift `β·x_pa` | `exp(β)` is an odds ratio — one number per edge |
| `cs` | complex shift `g(x_pa)` (MLP), still additive | plot `g` |
| `ci` | complex intercept: the transform's parameters depend on the parents (several `ci` parents feed one joint network) | maximal flexibility, interactions not interpretable |

Continuous nodes carry a monotone 1-D transform (`bernstein` — TRAM-faithful
default, `spline`, `affine`; `ContinuousNode(transform=..., transform_kwargs=...)`);
ordinal nodes an ordered-logit head `P(x ≤ k) = σ(θ_k − shift)`. Abduction is exact
for continuous nodes and truncated-logistic for ordinal ones, so
`flow.sample(u=flow.abduct(df))` reproduces `df` exactly / level-exactly.

There are two ways to fit the model: a stochastic deep learning optimizer (`fit`) and a 2nd order optimization like in the classical statistical models (`fit_classical`). The latter is more efficient for all-`ls` models (each node-conditional is then a classical transformation model). For more details, see the [`docs/fitting.md`](docs/fitting.md) file.

## Validation (all pinned by tests)

- **Paper replication** — every experiment of the CLeaR paper [TODO: double-check this, reformualte] is tested against the registry
  family (numpy-only SCM + frozen CSVs + replication script):

  | family | paper | demonstrates |
  |---|---|---|
  | `triangle` (`linear`,`atan`,`sin`) | §6.1 | LS coefficient recovery (β = 2, −0.2, +0.3), CS curve ≡ −f(x₂), non-monotone f |
  | `triangle-mixed` (`linear`,`exp`) | §6.2 | mixed data L1/L2 + the C.4 odds-ratio check (OR ≈ 7.4) |
  | `vaca` | §5.1–5.2 | the bimodal L1 case a default CNF misses; L2 `p(x₃ \| do(x₂))` |
  | `carefl` | §5.3 | L3 counterfactual curves vs **analytic** truth |

  ```bash
  cd experiments && uv run python paper_triangle.py atan cs   # etc., see paper_*.py
  ```

  Sign note: ordinal shifts are *subtracted* here but *added* in the paper, so
  fitted ordinal weights are the paper's with flipped sign (`truth.json` records
  both conventions per family).

- **Exact classical equivalence** — an all-`ls` flow trained to convergence *is*
  the proportional-odds MLE: coefficients match `statsmodels` **and** R
  `MASS::polr` to ~4 decimals (`experiments/validate_ls.py`, R reference committed
  under `data/magic-mrclean/*/ref_ls/`).

- **Training speed** — schedules, per-node freezing, LBFGS and device benchmarks:
  [`docs/training-speed.md`](docs/training-speed.md).

What the tests actually guarantee — the principles behind them (known identities,
the datasets and software they compare against, and how the ground truth was
obtained) — is documented in [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md).

<!-- ## Case study: individualized treatment effects in stroke



The method's flagship application estimates individualized thrombectomy effects
from the observational MAGIC cohort with external validation against the
MR CLEAN trial:

> Dürr, Herzog, Bühler, Wegener & Sick, *Estimating Individualized Treatment
> Effects in Acute Ischemic Stroke with Causal Transformation Models (TRAM-DAG)*
> ([arXiv:2606.12623](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.12623)).

The clinical data is private and **never** part of this repo. Its public
stand-in is `data/magic-mrclean/` — a fully synthetic cohort with the same
schema and **known ground truth** (true ATE, true individual counterfactuals),
including an `nl` variant where an all-`ls` model is provably misspecified:

| `nl` variant | ATE | vs true **+0.104** |
|---|---|---|
| naive observational contrast | +0.303 | confounded (overstates 2.9×) |
| all-`ls` flow | +0.076 | undershoots (misses the age-varying effect) |
| flexible (`ci`/`cs`) flow | +0.101 | **recovers the truth** | -->
