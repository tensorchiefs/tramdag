"""Compare an experiment's metrics against the committed ground truth.

The experiments workflow calls this after each run. Ground truth lives in
``<area>/ground_truth/<result-dir>.json`` as one entry per metric::

    {"_note": "what these numbers mean",
     "beta12": {"value": 1.9825, "atol": 0.05},
     "cs_curve_max_abs_err": {"max": 0.23}}

Two forms. ``{value, atol}`` is two-sided, for a quantity that should stay
where it is. ``{max}`` is an upper bound, for an **error measure**, where a
smaller number is a better fit rather than a drift and must not fail the run.

A ``{max}`` bound is only useful in a band. Below **1.5x** its measurement it
fails on another machine for no reason (measured: one such bound passed at
0.028 here and failed CI at 0.113). Above **4x** it cannot catch a regression.
A bound outside the band is reported as ``note`` — not a failure, because a
tolerance is a judgement call, but visibly, so it gets re-pinned deliberately
rather than drifting. A bound that is *meant* to be wide carries a ``"why"``
string, which is printed in place of the note::

    "max_abs_diff_flow_vs_statsmodels": {
      "max": 0.25,
      "why": "the max is over a coefficient with 7 of 1275 observations: 0.028
              here, 0.113 on the CI runner"}

A ``"why"`` excuses width only. The *too tight* note always fires, because no
argument makes a bound below 1.5x its measurement survive another machine.

A ``{value, atol}`` center decays the other way: it keeps passing while
describing an older run, drifting through its tolerance until one machine
tips it over. A measurement past **half** its ``atol`` is reported the same
way, so the center gets re-pinned while it still passes.

A key starting with an underscore is a note for the reader and is skipped.

Every entry needs its own tolerance, because torch results differ slightly
across operating systems and CPUs — a measured spread, not a hope. A metric
without an entry is reported and ignored; an entry without a metric is an
error, because that means the experiment stopped producing a number the
ground truth claims to check.

Usage (from ``experiments/``)::

    uv run python -m check paper triangle-atan-cs
