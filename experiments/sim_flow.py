"""The simulation storyline: known-truth recovery on the synthetic cohort.

On a chosen variant of `magic-mrclean` it fits BOTH the all-`ls` flow and the
flexible (`ci`/`cs`) flow, and reports each estimated ATE against the known true
ATE from `truth.json` — plus the naive (confounded) observational contrast.

Expected reading:
  - `nl` variant: the all-`ls` model is misspecified (it must collapse the
    age-varying treatment effect to one constant) and is biased; the flexible
    flow recovers the true ATE. Both beat the naive observational difference,
    which is badly confounded.
  - `ls` variant: both flows and the true ATE coincide (the DGP is all-`ls`).

Usage: uv run python sim_flow.py [ls|nl]   (default nl)
