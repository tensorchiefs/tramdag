# Notebooks

All notebooks in this repo are [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext)
**percent-format `.py` files** — plain Python with `# %%` cell markers and
markdown in `# %% [markdown]` cells. The `.py` file is always the **source of
truth**.

| notebook | what it is |
|---|---|
| `intro_tram_dag.py` | didactic walkthrough of the TRAM-DAG model (SI/CI/LS/CS, L1–L3, all claims checked against a hand-built SCM) |
| `transforms_tram_dag.py` | choosing the per-node transform (Bernstein / spline / affine) on the intro SCM: per-node NLL diagnosis, recovered h-curves, mixing transforms per node, capacity sweep, and why misspecification bends tail-risk do() queries |
| `classical_fit_tram_dag.py` | `fit_classical` for all-`ls` models: deterministic float64 L-BFGS vs Adam (bimodal demo), exact equivalence to statsmodels ordered-logit (stroke) with an R `tram::Colr` snippet, and the classical→further-training warm-start handoff |
| `ite_observational.py` | individual treatment effects from a confounded observational cohort: an all-CI S-learner TRAM-DAG recovers per-individual ITEs (abduction + `do`) on the `ITEObservational` mediation SCM, validated against known ground truth (r ≈ 0.99) |
| `demo_tram_dag_colab.py` | 5-minute showcase on the paper's bimodal VACA benchmark, GPU-ready ([open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorchiefs/tramdag/blob/main/notebooks/demo_tram_dag_colab.ipynb)) |

## Rules

- **Do not edit `.ipynb` files directly** — edit the `.py` and regenerate.
- **Do not commit `.ipynb` files.** They are git-ignored (embedded base64
  outputs ruin diffs). The single exception is `demo_tram_dag_colab.ipynb`,
  tracked **output-stripped** only so the Open-in-Colab badge works; after
  changing `demo_tram_dag_colab.py`, regenerate it before committing.

## Working with the notebooks

**VS Code / Cursor**: open the `.py` directly — with the Python + Jupyter
extensions every `# %%` cell gets a "Run Cell" link (pick the `.venv`
interpreter created by `uv sync`). No conversion needed.

**Classic Jupyter / JupyterLab**: generate a local `.ipynb` (stays untracked):

```bash
uvx jupytext --to ipynb notebooks/intro_tram_dag.py
```

For frequent notebook editing you can install jupytext into the venv instead of
using `uvx` each time: `uv sync --group notebooks`.

**Edit in a synced copy** (interactive notebook, `.py` stays the source of
truth): with the `notebooks` group installed, jupytext can keep a local `.ipynb`
paired to the `.py` so your interactive edits flow back into the tracked `.py`.

The cleanest way needs no `.ipynb` at all — in JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook,
right-click the `.py` → *Open With* → *Notebook*. Edits save straight back to the
`.py`; there is nothing to clean up.

If you'd rather click around in a real `.ipynb`, pair the two and sync edits back:

```bash
# one-time: create intro_tram_dag.ipynb paired to the .py
uv run jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:percent notebooks/intro_tram_dag.py
# ...edit the .ipynb in Jupyter, then push changes into the .py:
uv run jupytext --sync notebooks/intro_tram_dag.ipynb
```

The paired `.ipynb` stays git-ignored. Note that `--set-formats` adds `ipynb` to
the `.py` header — revert that one-line header change before committing (the
committed notebooks are paired to `py:percent` only).

**Headless check** (runs all cells top-to-bottom, plots suppressed):

```bash
MPLBACKEND=Agg uv run python notebooks/intro_tram_dag.py
```

**Regenerate the tracked Colab demo ipynb** after editing its `.py`:

```bash
uvx jupytext --to ipynb notebooks/demo_tram_dag_colab.py
```

(A fresh conversion contains no outputs, which is exactly the committed state.)
