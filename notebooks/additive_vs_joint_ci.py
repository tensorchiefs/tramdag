# # Additive vs joint complex intercept — interpreting per-parent effects
#
# A node whose transform parameters depend on its parents (a **complex
# intercept**, `I`) can group those parents two ways:
#
# - **joint** — `terms=[I("x1", "x2")]`: *one* network over both parents. It can
#   represent **interactions** (the effect of `x1` may depend on `x2`), but the
#   two parents are entangled in one black box.
# - **additive** — `terms=[I("x1"), I("x2")]`: *one network per parent*, summed
#   in unconstrained parameter space, `theta(pa) = net_1(x1) + net_2(x2)`. Each
#   parent reshapes the transform **independently** — a separable, GAM-like
#   structure.
#
# The additive form is the interpretable one: you can ask "what does `x1`
# *alone* do?". The catch (issue #20) is that the additive sum is identified only
# up to a constant moving between the nets, so the **raw** per-parent outputs are
# not comparable. `flow.intercept_contributions(node, data)` resolves this with a
# sum-to-zero (mean-centering) constraint and returns each parent's centered
# contribution.

# This notebook fits both models and shows the interpretability difference. The
# punchline is perhaps surprising: the two models fit the **data** almost
# identically — the difference is **structural**, visible only in parameter
# space, and that is precisely what `intercept_contributions` surfaces.

# ## The structural difference: separable curves vs an entangled cloud
#
# Pick the transform coefficient that varies most across the data and plot each
# term's centered contribution to it against a parent value.
#
# - **Additive** (`net_1` depends only on `x1`): its contribution to any
#   coefficient is a deterministic 1-D function of `x1` — the points collapse to
#   a **clean curve** (same for `x2`). These curves *are* the per-parent partial
#   effects: well-defined because the structure is separable.
# - **Joint** (one network over both parents): the single `x1+x2` component
#   depends on *both*, so plotted against `x1` alone it is a **cloud** whose
#   height is explained by the hidden `x2` (color). There is nothing to read off
#   per parent.

# ## Takeaway
#
# | you want… | use | what you get |
# |---|---|---|
# | a per-parent partial-effect plot ("what does `x1` do?") | **additive** `I("x1") + I("x2")` | `intercept_contributions` → exact, mean-centered, **separable** components |
# | interactions between parents in the transform | **joint** `I("x1", "x2")` | one entangled network — flexible, **not** separable |
#
# Both give correct likelihoods and L1/L2/L3 causal queries — the choice is about
# *interpretability*, not correctness, and (as the near-equal NLLs show) you
# usually can't distinguish them from the fitted distribution alone. The
# separability that makes per-parent effects well-defined is a property of the
# **parameter space**, and `intercept_contributions` is what surfaces it. It is
# post-hoc: it reads the fitted weights and changes nothing about the model.
#
# *Caveat:* contributions live in the transform's **unconstrained** parameter
# space (where the additive terms are summed, before the monotonicity
# constraint), so they are exact partial effects on the parameters but not, in
# general, an additive split of the curve `h` itself.
