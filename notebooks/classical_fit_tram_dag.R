# The R half of notebooks/classical_fit_tram_dag.py.

# Needs MASS (ships with R) and tram. `birthwt` comes from MASS, so Sections 0
# and 1 read no file at all; Section 1b reads the CSV the notebook tracks.
#
# A note on the Bernstein degree. The two libraries count the basis
# differently: the flow's `n_coeffs` unconstrained coefficients become
# `n_coeffs + 2` control points, that is a polynomial of degree `n_coeffs + 1`.
# So the notebook's `n_coeffs = 20` is tram's `order = 21`, not `order = 19`.

# glm cannot fit the model above: `binomial` needs a binary outcome, and there

# The notebook fits the flow both ways for the comparison: with a Bernstein
# baseline it reaches -1500.55, with a linear one -1507.62. The linear flow and
# lm differ only in the latent (logistic vs normal) and land within 1 nat.
#
# The `smoke` coefficient is +0.669 here and +0.671 from m0 above. A linear
# shift moves the whole latent distribution, so cutting the outcome at 2500 g
# discards information about the baseline transformation but not the shift.

# runs Bernstein there, leaving 10% of rows in linear tails, while Colr spends
# its whole basis on the observed support. Neither function class contains the
# other, so which fits better is a property of the node.
