# # Classical fitting of all-`ls` TRAM-DAGs (`fit_classical`)
#
# When **every edge of a TRAM-DAG is a linear shift (`ls`)**, each
# node-conditional is a *classical transformation model* — an ordered-logit /
# proportional-odds model for ordinal nodes, a continuous-outcome logistic
# transformation model (R's `tram::Colr`) for continuous ones. For such a model,
# minibatch Adam is an odd choice: thousands of epochs, a learning-rate schedule
# to tune, shuffle noise, and no reproducibility — to fit something classical
# software solves deterministically in milliseconds.
#
# `flow.fit_classical()` is the classical optimizer for exactly this case:
#
# - **full-batch, float64, L-BFGS** with a strong-Wolfe line search,
# - **deterministic** — no minibatching, so the same start gives bit-identical
#   results,
# - lands on the **exact maximum-likelihood estimate**, matching `statsmodels`
#   and R to ~1e-3 on the well-identified coefficients,
# - **raises** on any `cs`/`ci` edge (use `fit()` there — minibatch noise also
#   regularizes the MLPs).
#
# This notebook fits all-`ls` models with `fit_classical` on two datasets,
# checks them against the classical solution, and shows how a classical fit can
# **warm-start** further training.

# ## 1. Continuous case — the bimodal demo data
#
# The `VacaTriangle` benchmark (`x1 → x2 → x3 ← x1`, the demo notebook's bimodal
# SCM). We fit an **all-`ls`** model: each node is a continuous logistic
# transformation model with a Bernstein baseline and linear shifts.
#
# Note this is an *honest misspecification*: the DGP noise is Gaussian while the
# TRAM latent is logistic, so the all-`ls` model is not the true generator — but
# `fit_classical` still finds its exact MLE, which is the point here.

# ### Reproduce the continuous fit in R (`tram::Colr`)
#
# `statsmodels` has no continuous logistic transformation model, but R's `tram`
# package does — `Colr` fits exactly the per-node model above. For the
# `x3 | x1, x2` node (save `df` to `vaca.csv` first):
#
# ```r
# library(tram)
# d <- read.csv("vaca.csv")
# # Colr: continuous outcome logistic transformation model;
# # the linear-shift coefficients are log-odds ratios, comparable to
# # flow.ls_coefficients()["x3"] (up to tram's sign convention for the shift).
# m <- Colr(x3 ~ x1 + x2, data = d, order = 19)   # Bernstein order 19 ~ n_coeffs 20
# coef(m)        # -> the x1, x2 shift coefficients
# logLik(m)
# ```
#
# (The flow's Bernstein default is `n_coeffs=20`, i.e. polynomial order 19.)

# ## 2. Ordinal case — exact, self-contained classical check
#
# For an **ordinal** outcome the classical model is the ordered-logit, which
# `statsmodels.OrderedModel` fits — so here the equivalence is checkable in
# Python. The all-`ls` stroke DAG (`magic-mrclean/ls`):

# %%

# Age and NIHSSa match to ~1e-3; the treatment effect `T` is *weakly identified*

# 2. continuing with `fit()` from the classical solution *stays put* — confirming
#    it really is the optimum (and showing the classical fit as a fast, principled
#    initialization for further or richer training).

# ## When to use which
#
# | situation | use |
# |---|---|
# | all-`ls` model, final estimates / classical comparison / reproducibility | **`fit_classical`** |
# | any `cs`/`ci` edge (flexible model) | `fit(..., schedule="plateau")` |
# | need a fast, principled init for a flexible model | `fit_classical` (all-`ls` core) → upgrade edges → `fit()` |
#
# `fit_classical` is also the groundwork for **standard errors**: fitting at the
# MLE in float64 is exactly what a Hessian-based covariance needs (a future
# addition — see the CHANGELOG).
