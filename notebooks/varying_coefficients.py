# # Heterogeneous treatment effects: the `VC` term
#
# Most causal questions are not "does the treatment help?" but "**whom** does
# it help, and by how much?". A TRAM-DAG answers that with a
# **varying-coefficient** term, which gives one edge of the DAG a treatment
# effect that depends on covariates:
#
# $$\text{shift} \;\mathrel{+}=\; \beta(\text{modifiers})\cdot x_t,
#   \qquad \beta(x) = \beta_0 + b_\Theta(x)$$
#
# `beta0` is the constant part — an interpretable log-odds ratio, exactly as a
# linear shift would give — and `b_Theta` is a deliberately small, **penalized**
# network that bends it per individual.
#
# This notebook builds a DGP whose effect function we know exactly, fits the
# model, and scores the recovered `beta(x)` against the truth. It then shows
# the two things the term exists for that a plain flexible shift does not give:
# a read-out you can plot, and a **propensity-centered** variant that survives
# confounding.

#
# with $h(y) = 2y$, a nonlinear prognostic part
# $g(x) = \tfrac12 X_1^2 + X_2 - \tfrac12 X_3$, and the effect function
#
# $$\beta(x) = -1 + 0.8\,X_2 - 0.6\,X_3 .$$

# ## 6. Confounding: why `center=` exists
#
# Everything above had a prognostic part flexible enough to absorb $g$. Real
# models are misspecified, and when the misfit correlates with **treatment
# assignment**, the effect head absorbs the confounding instead of the effect.
#
# The configuration where this bites hardest is deliberately simple: one
# covariate, a strong propensity $e(x)=\sigma(2x)$, a constant true effect
# $\tau = -1$, and a quadratic prognostic part fitted with a linear term.
# `center="ps"` replaces $t$ by $t - \hat e(x)$ using **cross-fitted**
# (out-of-fold) propensities from the training-frame column `ps`, so the head
# sees the part of the treatment that the covariates do not explain. Stage 1 —
# the propensities — is yours: any classifier, predicted out of fold, merged
# into the frame as a column. Here, five classical fits of the treatment spec.

# Without centering the confounding swallows the effect almost entirely — the
# average estimate lands near zero when the truth is $-1$. With centering it
# recovers most of it, and the mean absolute error falls by roughly a factor of
# four. Centering costs nothing when the prognostic part is adequate, which is
# why it is worth reaching for whenever assignment is not random.

# ## What to take away
#
# | you want | use | read it with |
# |---|---|---|
# | one interpretable effect | `LS("T")` | `ls_coefficients()` |
# | an effect that varies with covariates | `VC(*modifiers, t="T")` | `varying_coef(df, node)` |
# | the same under confounding + a misspecified prognostic part | `VC(..., center="ps")` | the same read-out |
# | a shortlist of modifiers before you commit | `effect_modifier_scan` on a cheap all-`ls` fit | its `flag` column, read as screening |
#
# The alternative of writing `CS("T", "X2", "X3")` is equally *expressive* —
# any shift decomposes into arms — but nothing in the likelihood rewards a
# smooth difference between them, so the implied effect is the difference of
# two unregularized networks. On this task class that reduced form measures
# corr ≈ 0.5 against the truth. The `VC` term exists to put the
# regularization where the question is. See
# [`docs/varying-coefficients.md`](../docs/varying-coefficients.md) for the
# semantics and [`docs/scores.md`](../docs/scores.md) for the scan.
