"""Synthetic-cohort generators for tramdag.

Each scenario is one module exposing a numpy-only SCM generator class with known
causal ground truth. New scenarios register here so experiments/tests can look
them up by name. Frozen CSVs live under ``data/<name>/`` and are a contract —
regenerate only deliberately via each module's CLI.
