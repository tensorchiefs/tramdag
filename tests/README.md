# Tests — what they guarantee

`tramdag` is a *methods* package, so its tests are written to verify **claims**,
not to chase a line-coverage number. We deliberately do **not** track a coverage
percentage: "which lines ran" says nothing about whether the causal estimates are
correct. What matters here is that the flow reproduces known mathematical
identities, agrees with independent implementations, and recovers ground truth we
can compute exactly. This file describes those contracts and where each lives.

## Running the tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -q            # everything (~12 min: the slow fits dominate)
uv run pytest tests/ -q -m "not slow"   # fast subset (~30 s) — unit + contracts
uv run pytest tests/test_flow.py -q     # one file
```

- **`slow` marker** — the long fit/training tests (they train flows) are marked
  `@pytest.mark.slow`. `-m "not slow"` skips them.
- **CI** ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs the fast
  subset on every pull request and push to `main`, and the **full** suite nightly
  and on demand (Actions → CI → *Run workflow*). The split exists because the full
  suite is ~25–40 min on the 2-core runners.
- **Determinism** — tests seed `torch` before constructing the flow (weight init
  happens at construction), so fits are reproducible.

## Testing principles

Five kinds of test, in rough order of how much trust they carry:

1. **Known mathematical identities** — properties that must hold by the math,
   independent of any reference implementation:
   - the monotone transforms invert exactly (`test_univariate_roundtrip`);
   - abduction → push-forward reproduces the data (bijective round-trip,
     `test_abduction_roundtrip`);
   - the joint `log_prob` equals the sum of per-node terms
     (`test_log_prob_finite_and_decomposes`);
   - each triangle DGP really is a TRAM — the reconstructed latent is standard
     logistic by a KS test (`test_triangle_continuous_tram_identity`);
   - a `do` intervention changes only descendants
     (`test_counterfactual_only_changes_descendants`).

2. **Equivalence to independent implementations** — the strongest external check:
   an all-`ls` model *is* a classical transformation model, so it must match
   software written by other people in other languages.
   - vs. **`statsmodels`** `OrderedModel` (computed at test time):
     `test_all_ls_flow_is_exact_mle`, `test_ls_node_equals_proportional_odds`,
     `test_matches_statsmodels_mle`;
   - vs. **R** `MASS::polr` / `tram::Colr` / `glm` (committed reference, see below):
     `test_flow_matches_r_reference`;
   - the two optimizers agree on the same optimum: `test_agrees_with_adam_mle`.

3. **Known-truth recovery** — because the simulators *are* the ground truth, we
   can check the flow recovers quantities no real dataset would expose:
   - the true ATE from the SCM (`test_flow_recovers_true_ate`,
     `test_true_ate_positive_and_confounded`);
   - the paper DGPs' true coefficients / shift curves / cutpoints
     (`test_triangle_*_recovers_*`);
   - interventional moments (`test_vaca_ci_flow_matches_interventional_moments`)
     and individual counterfactuals
     (`test_carefl_ci_flow_recovers_counterfactuals`);
   - the headline storyline: all-`ls` underestimates, flexible recovers
     (`test_nl_storyline_all_ls_underestimates_flexible_recovers`).

4. **Frozen-data contracts** — the committed CSVs under `data/` are a contract,
   not a convenience. Tests assert each regenerates **bit-identically** from its
   stored seed, so the data can never drift silently underneath the truth files
   (`test_frozen_csvs_present_and_match_truth`, `test_frozen_csv_contract`).

5. **Numerical-stability & invariant guards** — regressions we've been bitten by:
   - the ordinal log-likelihood keeps non-zero gradients under float32 saturation
     (`test_ordinal_log_prob_gradient_survives_saturation`) — the naive sigmoid
     difference would freeze a node at init;
   - cutpoints stay increasing and PMFs sum to one
     (`test_ordinal_cutpoints_increasing_and_pmf_sums_to_one`);
   - `save`/`load` round-trips a fitted model (`test_save_load_roundtrip`);
   - schedules/freezing don't break the exact-MLE property
     (`test_plateau_freeze_preserves_exact_mle`);
   - DAG validation catches cycles and orders correctly
     (`test_cycle_detection`, `test_topological_order`).

## How the ground truth is obtained

The reference values the tests compare against come from four sources, in
decreasing order of exactness:

- **By construction.** The paper DGPs are *built as* TRAMs with fixed
  coefficients, cutpoints and shift functions
  ([`simulations/triangle.py`](../src/tramdag/simulations/triangle.py)), so the
  true parameters are simply the numbers used to generate the data.
- **Analytically.** Where the SCM allows a closed form: the VACA benchmark's
  interventional moments (Gaussian; `E[x₃ | do(x₂=a)] = −0.25 + 0.25a`) and the
  CAREFL benchmark's individual counterfactuals (additive Laplace noise recovered
  exactly by abduction) — [`simulations/vaca.py`](../src/tramdag/simulations/vaca.py),
  [`simulations/carefl.py`](../src/tramdag/simulations/carefl.py).
- **Monte Carlo from the SCM.** Where no closed form exists, the truth is a
  large-sample estimate from the generator itself — e.g. the stroke cohort's true
  ATE is the do-effect averaged over a 500k-row interventional draw
  (`MagicMrClean.true_ate`), stored in each `truth.json`. The numpy simulators are
  deliberately independent of the flow, so this is a genuine external reference.
- **Independent software.** The classical-equivalence tests fit `statsmodels`
  `OrderedModel` at test time, and compare against an **R** reference
  (`MASS::polr` / `tram::Colr` / `glm`, script
  [`data/magic-mrclean/fit_ls.R`](../data/magic-mrclean/fit_ls.R)) whose outputs
  are committed under `data/magic-mrclean/*/ref_ls/` so the tests run without an R
  installation. Details: [`data/magic-mrclean/README.md`](../data/magic-mrclean/README.md).

## The test files

| file | what it covers |
|---|---|
| [`test_flow.py`](test_flow.py) | core unit tests — transforms, ordinal log-prob, DAG validation, abduction/counterfactual mechanics, `save`/`load`, the proportional-odds identity |
| [`test_simulations.py`](test_simulations.py) | the stroke simulator — schema/determinism, RCT de-confounding, known-truth ATE recovery, exact-MLE vs `statsmodels`, the R-reference regression |
| [`test_paper_dgps.py`](test_paper_dgps.py) | the paper DGPs — generator pinning (KS identities, frozen-CSV contract, analytic ground truth) + flow recovery of each family's truth |
| [`test_fit_schedules.py`](test_fit_schedules.py) | lr schedules and per-node freezing, incl. the guard that plateau+freeze still lands on the MLE |
| [`test_fit_classical.py`](test_fit_classical.py) | `fit_classical` — guard on non-`ls` specs, determinism, float64 round-trip, agreement with `statsmodels` and Adam |

## Adding tests

- New causal features should be validated against a simulator's **known truth**
  (`MagicMrClean.true_ate`; `counterfactual_pair` gives true individual
  counterfactuals via shared latents), not just "runs without error".
- Mark anything that trains a flow `@pytest.mark.slow` so PR CI stays fast.
- Treat `data/` as frozen: a new seed or new equations means a **new folder**
  (regenerate any R reference), never an in-place edit — see the project testing
  policy in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
