"""Fixtures shared by the test modules.

Two kinds of fixture live here: helpers that are provably identical
across files, and the three **inline DGPs** the framework tests measure
against. The DGPs are numpy-only and deliberately independent of the flow
implementation — they are the ground truth. They live here (and not in a
simulation package) because the framework must be testable on its own:
the research generators and their frozen CSVs belong to ``experiments/``.

Each DGP fixture gives a dict, so a test names what it takes:

- ``draw(n, seed)`` — a fresh sample, one column per variable
- ``truth`` — the DGP's coefficients, the values a fit must recover
- ``beta(df)`` — the pointwise true effect function (VC DGPs only)

Specs stay in the test modules: those pin the one syntax variant a
property needs, and sharing them would couple unrelated acceptance bars.
